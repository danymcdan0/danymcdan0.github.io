        <p>Drop Sort is a game targeted towards providing aid in the development of children with Autistic Spectrum
            Disorder. Behavioral therapies are the standard treatments for children with ASD but they are very time and
            resource intensive, especially during COVID. As the world is shifting towards a more online environment due
            to COVID, having a way for patients to still progress with their therapies is essential. The objective of
            Drop Sort is to help reduce the strain on therapeutic services by exploring the fact that Children with
            autism are also known to be "heavy use gamers." Drop Sort aims to tackle a core part of Pivotal Response
            Treatment known as conditional discrimination through training multiple cue responding which is where when
            asked the question: "What color is the cat?" The response of the child is "meow" instead of the color of the
            cat as the child only recognized 'cat'. Drop Sort is a sorting game created with C# in Unity utilizing its
            navmesh agents, rigidbody, ontrigger methods and much more, where the player has to sort entities correctly
            according to cues, getting increasingly difficult over time. Further progress is saved over time to see the
            improvements of the player by a therapist which was one of the main aims of the project.</p>

        <p>5 Year Mission, also referred to as 5YM, is a colony simulation game targeted toward understanding
            the decision-making process of an individual while playing a game. There are various different
            intentions behind a game, evoking different emotions which dictate gameplay, but this project will
            focus on games that attempt to form an attachment between the player and in-game entities. Colony
            simulation games are able to create a connection with the player while also providing the
            infrastructure for the player to make independent decisions, between prioritizing attachments or
            progression in the game. Research into an individual's decision-making process in games has been
            scarcely documented compared to in the real world, hence this project aims to add to this field which
            is ripe for investigation. 5YM was created with C# in Unity utilizing various algorithms such as Moore's
            Neighbours and Perlin noise for the map generation, followed by a grid system for an A* search
            algorithm integrated with Unity's Rigid body system for pathfinding. The objective of the game is to
            aid a group of stranded colonists to reach their home planet by directing them to do tasks as an
            overlord, collecting the necessary resources for the final 5 Year Mission home. The game presents
            various scenarios in which the player is typically given two options, attachment or progression of the
            game where their decisions are recorded to be analysed for the research purpose of this project.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>The idea of this game was inspired by two things: </p>
        <p> 1) One of the top colony simulation games Rimworld, where you essentially play 'god' and manage a colony of
            people and the areas resources.
        </p>
        <p> 2) My previous project called 5 Year Mission.
        </p>
        <p>I wanted to take my learnings from my previous projects and have a completely different experience in a
            colony sim but with the same level of control (if not slightly simplified) compared to Rimworld, but also
            wanted to take it in a direction that is currently a popular topic for people but show it in a different
            light or perspective.
            To this end, currently with sir Elon stirring the pot about colonization of Mars, I thought what other
            options are there? This led me to jump into the rabbit hole of Venus. To put it simply I found the concept
            of living in a sky city fascinating and want to be able to simulate what that might be like. Hence the idea
            of PROJECT: Venus was born, combining the colony simulation aspect and the current real world craze for
            colonization of planets but taking it in a direction that hasn't been over saturated yet, Venus.
        </p>
        <p>The initial system I wanted to flesh out was the grids, in particular the sky grid where the player would be
            spending most of their time managing their airships. So to approach this I first wanted to implement grid in
            Unity and followed with trying take the mouse position to convert to a world position which then would be
            converted to cell positions (or vice versa). Correct approach me, but what about handling the object
            placement location and saving where they are on the grid? <s>Well we can first try to get the size of the
                prefab we would like to place and try to carry that over when the object is being moved or rotated, and
                then
                try to use a Boxfill type approach to mark some areas as occupied or not on the grid.</s> Enough of
            that,
            instead lets utilize the beauty of a Scriptable Object based database which would hold all the information
            about the placeable object including it size, avoiding the need to deal with any other nonsense. I found a
            very informative approach to this through a channel called Sunny Valley Studio on youtube and was able to
            create my own version of this while also implementing the State Pattern allowing for cleaner code and the
            state dictating weather to place/delete an object on the grid. I also messed around a lot with shaders and
            shader graph to be able to use the URP for visual changes/effects to the placement grid system.</p>

        <br>
        <p>For chunk generation, this being the ground grid of which the player would eventually be able to extract
            resources from to keep their sky city afloat, I didn't want the world to be already loaded in, as that could
            eventually take up a lot of memory and cause lag in the game. To avoid this I pretty much made my own
            version of Minecraft chunk generation where the game would load the neighboring chunks to the sky grid
            (which could move left or right now as in the future I wanted wind direction to influence travel) and remove
            chunks that the skygrid has strayed too far from.</p>
        <p>The chunks are generated and saved to a list (List < int[,]> Chunks) where each chunk has values representing
                a different prefab to be placed in that grid position when generated. This can easily be expanded in the
                future where I am able to create a random chunk generator which will be able to ensure certain resources
                are available in that chunk, and also allows for chunks to be saved and loaded when the time come to
                implement saved worlds.</p>

        <p>There comes a point where the concept of KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) is the best way to live life, and this
            next iteration of this development hammered that in. So until now my airships were nothing serious
            (placeholders) and the size of them were just varying to ensure that the previous systems were working
            correctly, but now that I wanted to be able to interact with airships and place objects inside of them and I
            experimented with the idea of trying to manipulate the sizing of the grid inside the airship to be smaller
            than the standard skygrid. This ended up just
            over complicating things and could mean lower quality objects in the future as there is less space for them
            so lets stick to
            whole numbers for the grid and maybe make the objects placed themselves smaller.</p>
        <p>The solution? I call it "The Great Scale Rework" where the size of the sky grid was increased, the cameras
            adjusted, and all the original airships were excommunicated. I was able to create a new airship which contained a
            grid
            for itself and would (hopefully) represent the scale and sizing of all the other airship types to be
            developed in the future, with each cell in the interior of the ship was a 1x1 space. This would only mean
            that the prefabs inside would be of the size 0.75x allowing for easier and smoother placement without having
            to deal with decimal numbers.</p>
